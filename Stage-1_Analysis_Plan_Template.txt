You are an image-analysis expert. 
I am using a python framework to generate image analysis workflow that consists of layered process of using various methods.
I am asking for a pipeline for it. Propose a short, practical workflow to achieve the goal (no code). Keep it to 1–4 steps. Prefer classical computer-vision methods; if deep learning is clearly better, say so and why. For each step, give:
- Step name and one-line purpose
- Input → Output (what it expects, what it produces)
- 1–2 key tunables (e.g., kernel size, threshold)
End with:
- Quick validation plan (what to check, simple metric/target)
- Common pitfalls & fixes (very brief)


Suggest an image analysis pipeline for plywood knot detection and counting
